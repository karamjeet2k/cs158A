# A5: Secure Socket (CS158A – Summer 2025)

##  Description
This assignment demonstrates how to create a secure HTTPS connection using Python’s `socket` and `ssl` modules. The script connects to `www.google.com` on port 443, sends an HTTP GET request, receives the response, and saves the HTML to a file.

##  Files
- secureget.py: Python script that opens a secure connection, sends the request, and saves the HTML.
- response.html: The saved HTML page returned from Google’s server.

##  How to Run
1. Open terminal and navigate to the folder.
2. Run the script using:
     bash
   python secureget.py
   
3. Open response.html in your browser to see the output.

##  Tasks Completed
- [x] Used SSL with socket to create a secure TCP connection
- [x] Connected to `www.google.com` on port 443
- [x] Sent a valid HTTP GET request to `/`
- [x] Received the HTTP response and saved it
