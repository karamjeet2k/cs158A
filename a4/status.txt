a3 passed all tests.
My original a3 submission ran successfully, but I made a small improvement for better stability.

I added a time.sleep(5) delay after the client connection retry (after the except block), to ensure that all neighbor servers are ready before sending the initial election message.

This update prevents race conditions during message passing and ensures consistent leader election in every test run.

All tests pass successfully with this version.
