## ðŸ“„ Description

This project implements a distributed leader election algorithm using an asynchronous non-anonymous ring network model. Each node is represented by a Python process using sockets, multithreading, and a UUID-based election protocol.

The goal is to elect a unique leader (node with the highest UUID) where:
- Only one leader is chosen (Uniqueness)
- All nodes agree on the same leader (Agreement)
- The election terminates (Termination)

## ðŸ§ª How to Run the Program

> Open 3 terminal windows, one for each Python file. Run them 2â€“3 seconds apart.

### Example:
cmd
# Terminal 1
python myleprocess1.py

# Terminal 2 (after 2â€“3 seconds)
python myleprocess2.py

# Terminal 3 (after 2â€“3 seconds)
python myleprocess3.py
Once the leader election completes, each terminal should print something like:

 Leader is decided to d46fbc87-0db5-4152-a3f0-d27a2793925a
 Expected Output
Each log*.txt file should contain:

The process's UUID

Received and sent messages

Flag value (0 = election, 1 = leader found)
